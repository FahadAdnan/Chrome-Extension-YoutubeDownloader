# Chrome-Extension-YoutubeDownloader
A chrome extension that automatically downloads Youtube videos for you with the use of an external website. 
Checks when a pages and links are loaded using Mutation Observers along with a variety of other tools.

## Why I Made It:


The chrome store does not allow any youtube downloaders as they breach their privacy rules. 
I decided to make one that would act as an alternative downloader, using an external website instead of downloading directly 
at an attempt to bypass chrome store policies.

Note: The chrome store REJECTED my extension as it still counts as breaking their downloading from youtube regulations. 
So I made it possible for you to download it on your own.


## Steps to get UtubeDownloader:

1) Download zip file of extension
2) Extract file which should give you a folder
3) Go to chrome://extensions
4) On the top right corner click the Developer mode switch
5) Press the newly reveled load unpacked button (top-left under Extensions heading)
6) Select the unzipped folder and enjoy

Feel free to modify the code to your liking. :)
